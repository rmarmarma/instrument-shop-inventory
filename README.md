# instrument-shop-inventory

This project is a programming assignment from the Software Design course taught at Trinity College in Hartford Connecticut. The purpose
of this assignment is to design an inventory system for a model instrument shop. 

This assignment is an extension of an original assignment where the shop only sold guitars. Here's the write-up for the original project:

Rick owns a guitar shop and has been selling acoustic and electric guitars for many years. He is
an expert in guitars and specializes in finding the perfect instrument for his customers. He always
has a great selection of guitars and is confident that he can find the right guitar for any customer. In
fact, his guitar selection is so good that all of the brands that he carries made the list of top 10 guitar
brands in the world.
Rick is a bit old-school and he has been using a paper-based guitar inventory system for many
years. His approach is tried and true. He would keep a list of all guitars in stock. Then, for each
guitar, he would keep track of the guitar’s serial number, price, brand, model, type, type of top
wood, type of back wood, To keep it manageable, he would limit the types of wood to rosewood,
alder, mahogany and cedar. After all, these were all top choices for guitar wood. When meeting a
new customer, Rick would get to know the customer’s needs through a friendly conversation about
the customer’s preferences and music experience, and then he would simply consult his list.
This approach has been working well, however, his business has been getting so popular that he
has decided to throw out the old system and move to a computer-based system. Rick figured that
a computer inventory program with a search tool to help him match up a customer to their dream
instrument would allow him to increase his business in many ways. He could even expand and hire
someone to help him manage the inventory! Adding, removing and modifying guitar entires has
never been his favorite task.
While Rick is excited about the possibility of computerizing his business, he is a bit concerned
about fulfilling his core mission: finding the perfect instrument for his customers. He is anxious
to test a version of his new system that allows him to use the new search tool and to manage the
inventory as soon as possible.

Goals

Your job is to carefully design and properly implement a program that works according to the specifications above. You are free to make any and all necessary assumptions based on your understanding of the problem overview. I want you to apply everything you know about Java, object-oriented
programming, problem solving, writing good code, and producing good software to create the best
solution you possibly can.

While originally the shop only sold guitars, the shop upgraded its capabilities and began selling other instruments to simulate change that occurs 
in a real world environment. The code files in this repository represent the new shop.
